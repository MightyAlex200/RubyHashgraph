# Hashgraph implementation in Ruby

This repository contains an implementation of the Hashgraph distributed byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm written in Ruby.
The algorithm is patented by Leemon Baird and Swirlds. The whitepaper can be found [here](http://www.swirlds.com/downloads/SWIRLDS-TR-2016-01.pdf).

This implementation is not official and probably has bugs. Use at your own risk.
